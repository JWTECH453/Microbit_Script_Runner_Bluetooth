# Run Scripts via bluetooth with a microbit

I had the idea to run script like you would on a flipper zero but with a microbit. In Microsoft MakeCode you can program a microbit but normaly you can't run code via bluetooth unless you have a V2 Microbit with an extension. Here you can see it:

Here you can use the microbit like a keybord or ducky. As an example it can spell a whole word/sentect when you give it the singal.

If you connect it to your laptop you can make it open cmd with button A. Then with button B you can run a script then.

Code Example

You can implement the code from cmd from iex .... to something difrent.
